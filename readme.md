# My story

### how did you started coding ?
i started to code **2 year ago**. exacly the 24 august 2019 when i needed to make a bot for my profile on instagram, everything started by "i have nothing to do", i started to code by PHP then followed with HTML, CSS, JS, then finally learned SQL.

### why do you keep coding ?
the only responce to write here is coding my fav thing to do. its literally the only domain i can exploit all my potential, since im gifted for never give up (on code ofc), i started to explore more further programming code, and started to learn about hacking.
